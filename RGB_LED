NOTE:- Check First Your RGB is Common Anode or Common Cathode.
##IF Your RGB have Common Anode.
LED Color	Arduino Pin	Connection
Red	D5 (PWM)	Through resistor to Red leg
Green	D6 (PWM)	Through resistor to Green leg
Blue	D3 (PWM)	Through resistor to Blue leg
Common (Anode)	+5V	Connect to Arduino 5V pin

##IF Your RGB have Common Cathode.
LED Color	Arduino Pin	Connection
Red	D5 (PWM)	Through resistor to Red leg
Green	D6 (PWM)	Through resistor to Green leg
Blue	D3 (PWM)	Through resistor to Blue leg
Common (Cathode)	  Connect to Arduino GND pin

Use 220–330Ω resistors between each LED leg and Arduino pin.
